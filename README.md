# NBA Geek

Introducing NBA Geek - an innovative web application that brings the fascinating world of NBA data right at your fingertips!

Developed as my capstone project during my [web development bootcamp](https://www.neuefische.de/bootcamp/web-development), this app is designed to captivate basketball enthusiasts and data lovers alike.

With NBA Geek, users can dive into a treasure trove of NBA data, spanning all the way back to 1946. Immerse yourself in a comprehensive collection of team information, game records, and player stats, allowing you to unravel the rich history of the league and its legendary figures.

This app utilizes the [balldontlie API](https://www.balldontlie.io/home.html#introduction) to retrieve real-time NBA statistics. A huge thank you goes out to balldontlie for generously providing this invaluable API, which serves as the backbone of this app's functionality! &#x1F60A;
